# UnitTest

## Non Isolated Test using TestBed and fixture: Testing component, service creation, getting the property data and async property data, displaying the correct data in the template...
## Isolated test - Pipe as an example: A pipe can be tested completely independent from angular, because it has a transform function where we pass a string in and we get a string out. We could create it completely independent from a test ENV no need for TestBed or fixture.  A simple new MyPipe will do.
