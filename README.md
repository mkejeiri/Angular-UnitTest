# UnitTest

##Non Isolated Test using TestBed and fixture: Testing component, service creation, getting the property data and async property data, displaying the correct data in the template...
##Isolated test - Pipe as an example: A pipe can be tested completely independent from angular, because it has a transform function where we pass a string in and we get a string out. We could create it completely independent from a test ENV no need for TestBed or fixture.  A simple new MyPipe will do.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
